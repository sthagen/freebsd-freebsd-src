.Dt DIV 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm div ,
.Nm ldiv ,
.Nm lldiv ,
.Nm imaxdiv
.Nd return quotient and remainder from division
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libc
.In stdlib.h
.Ft div_t
.Fn div "int numer" "int denom"
.Ft ldiv_t
.Fn ldiv "long numer" "long denom"
.Ft lldiv_t
.Fn lldiv "long long numer" "long long denom"
.In inttypes.h
.Ft imaxdiv_t
.Fn imaxdiv "intmax_t numer" "intmax_t denom"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn div ,
.Fn ldiv ,
.Fn lldiv ,
and
.Fn imaxdiv
functions compute the value of
.Fa numer
(the numerator) divided by
.Fa denom
(the denominator) and return the stored result in the form of the
.Fa div_t ,
.Fa ldiv_t ,
.Fa lldiv_t ,
or
.Fa imaxdiv_t
types, respectively.
These types are structs which contain two
.Vt int ,
.Vt long ,
.Vt long long ,
or
.Vt intmax_t
members named
.Va quot
(the quotient) and
.Va rem
(the remainder).
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn div ,
.Fn ldiv ,
.Fn lldiv ,
and
.Fn imaxdiv
functions conform to
.St -isoC-2023
and
.St -p1003.1-2024 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn div
and
.Fn ldiv
functions first appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
The
.Fn lldiv
and
.Fn imaxdiv
functions first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
