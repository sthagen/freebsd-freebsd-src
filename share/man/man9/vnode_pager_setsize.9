.Sh NAME
.Nm vnode_pager_setsize
.Nd "notify the VM system about updates in the file size"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In vm/vm.h
.In vm/vm_extern.h
.Ft void
.Fn vnode_pager_setsize "struct vnode *vp" "vm_ooffset_t nsize"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
lets the VM system know about a change in size for a file.
Content beyond the new EOF specified by the
.Fa nsize
argument will be purged from the cache.
This function is useful for use within file system code to implement
truncation in
.Xr VOP_SETATTR 9 .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
In case the new EOF specified by the
.Fa nsize
argument is not aligned to page boundaries,
partial-page area starting beyond the EOF will be zeroed.
In partial-page area,
for content occupying whole blocks within block
boundaries,
the dirty bits for the corresponding blocks will be cleared.
.Sh LOCKING
Writer lock of the VM object of
.Fa vp
will be held within the function.
